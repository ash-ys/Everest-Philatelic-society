    <h1>history of Postal stamps in Nepal</h1>
    <p>Nepal issued its first postage stamps in 1881, under the rule of Prime Minister Chandra Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana. The stamps featured the image of King Tribhuvan, who had recently ascended to the throne. In the following decades, Nepal issued a number of stamps with various designs, including images of Hindu gods and goddesses, cultural symbols, and historical figures.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Nepal began issuing stamps with more modern designs, including images of airplanes, spacecraft, and other technological advances. In recent years, Nepal has also issued stamps with themes related to natural beauty, cultural heritage, and important events in the country's history.

Overall, the history of postal stamps in Nepal reflects the country's rich cultural history and its development over time.</p>
